## Haxelib


Besides using Haxelib, you can use this git repos as a development directory:

```
haxelib dev hxmeteor path/to/folder
```

or use git directly

```
haxelib git hxmeteor https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/hxexterns.git
```

don't forget to add it to your build file

```
-lib hxexterns
```
