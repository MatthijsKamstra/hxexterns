## Haxe Externs

What is the best way to start with this: read this [tutorial](howto.md)



## Haxelib

__Use this at your own risk!__


Use this git directly

```bash
haxelib git hxexterns https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/hxexterns.git
```

You can use this git repos as a development directory:

```bash
haxelib dev hxexterns path/to/folder
```

don't forget to add it to your build file

```bash
-lib hxexterns
```
